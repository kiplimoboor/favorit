## Hotel Favorit Reservation System

This is a purely backend hotel reservation REST api built with go.

### Structure of the System
The system is configured with a default superuser with the following credentials:

>  *email: root@root.com* 
>   *password: root*

The system has two type of users: the admin, and the staff user.  The default superuser is an admin that can add other admin and staff users. A user labelled *staff* can only add guests to the system, make reservations, and cancel reservations made. The admin can also handle these tasks.
